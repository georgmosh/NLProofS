Hypothesis: the water from the melted ice cube will then evaporate
Context:
sent1: a pan is put on an open flame 
sent2: a flame is a part of a fire 
sent3: evaporation means a substance changes from a liquid into a gas by increasing heat energy 
sent4: if a substance is exposed to a source of heat then that substance may become hot / warm 
sent5: becoming hot means increasing in heat energy 
sent6: an ice cube is placed in the pan 
sent7: if thermal conductor is exposed to a source of heat then that conductor may become hot / warm 
sent8: a hot object is a source of heat 
sent9: metal is a thermal conductor 
sent10: fire gives off heat 
sent11: a source of something gives off that something 
sent12: melting means a substance changes from a solid into a liquid by increasing heat energy 
sent13: if something is placed over a heat source then that something is exposed to that heat source 
sent14: a pan is made of metal for cooking 
sent15: if an object is exposed to a source of heat then that object may become hot 
sent16: an ice cube is a kind of object 
sent17: a pan is a kind of object 
Proof: sent14 & sent9 -> int1: a pan is a thermal conductor; sent10 & sent2 -> int2: the flame gives off heat; int2 & sent11 -> int3: the flame is a source of heat; int3 & sent1 & sent13 -> int4: the pan is exposed to a source of heat; int1 & int4 & sent7 -> int5: the pan will become hot; int5 & sent17 -> int6: the hot pan is a kind of hot object; int6 & sent8 -> int7: the hot pan is a source of heat; int7 & sent13 & sent6 -> int8: the ice cube in the hot pan is exposed to a source of heat; int8 & sent15 & sent16 -> int9: the ice cube in the hot pan will become hot; int9 & sent12 & sent5 -> int10: the ice cube will melt and change into water in hot the pan; int10 & int7 -> int11: the water from the melted ice cube in the pan is exposed to a source of heat; int11 & sent4 -> int12: the water from the melted ice cube will become hot; int12 & sent3 & sent5 -> hypothesis;

Hypothesis: the wood will increase temperature slower
Context:
sent1: if a spoon is used to stir a liquid then that spoon is touching that liquid 
sent2: the spoon is used to stir soup 
sent3: soup is a kind of thing 
sent4: the soup is cooking on the stove 
sent5: a thermal insulator slows the transfer of heat 
sent6: if two things are touching then heat energy will be transferred between those things 
sent7: the spoon in the example is made of wood 
sent8: a spoon is a kind of thing 
sent9: wood is an thermal insulator 
sent10: cooking food requires adding heat energy to the food 
sent11: transferring of heat causes the object to increase in temperature

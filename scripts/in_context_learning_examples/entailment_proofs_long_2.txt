Hypothesis: cutting down a forest causes deer to move to find shelter in another habitat
Context:
sent1: if a habitat can no longer support animals then those animals will move to another area 
sent2: cutting down trees in a forest causes the number of trees to decrease in that forest 
sent3: if something is destroyed then that something no longer exists 
sent4: a deer lives in a forest 
sent5: cutting down a forest means cutting down trees in a forest 
sent6: if a habitat is removed then that habitat is destroyed 
sent7: if an animal 's habitat no longer exists then that animal will die 
sent8: a deer is a kind of animal 
sent9: animals live in their habitat 
sent10: if the state of a habitat causes animals in that habitat to die then that habitat can not support animals 
sent11: a shelter is used for living in by animals 
sent12: decreasing the number of trees in a forest is a kind of method for removing a forest 
Proof: sent10 & sent7 -> int1: if an animal's habitat no longer exists then that habitat can not support that animal; int1 & sent3 -> int2: if a habitat is destroyed then that habitat can not support animals; int2 & sent1 -> int3: habitat destruction causes animals to move to another habitat; sent11 & sent9 -> int4: animals' shelters are in their habitats; int3 & int4 -> int5: habitat destruction causes animals to move to find shelter in another habitat; sent2 & sent5 -> int6: cutting down a forest causes the number of trees to decrease in that forest; int6 & sent12 -> int7: cutting down a forest is a kind of method for removing a forest; int7 & sent6 -> int8: cutting down a forest will destroy a forest; int5 & int8 -> int9: cutting down a forest causes animals that live in that forest to move to find shelter in another habitat; sent4 & sent8 -> int10: deer are a kind of animal that live in a forest; int10 & int9 -> hypothesis;

Hypothesis: a plant requires a specific climate to grow and survive
Context:
sent1: if an organism requires something then that something is a resource for that organism 
sent2: clouds can block sunlight 
sent3: a plant is a kind of organism 
sent4: different plants require different amounts of certain resources to grow / survive 
sent5: precipitation is a property of weather 
sent6: a plant requires photosynthesis to grow / survive 
sent7: climate is a property of environment 
sent8: temperature is a property of weather 
sent9: precipitation is water that falls to the ground from clouds 
sent10: plants require water for survival / to grow 
sent11: if something is a property of something else then that something else determines that something 
sent12: a plant requires sunlight to perform photosynthesis 
sent13: climate is the usual kind of weather in a location over a period of time 
Proof: sent13 & sent7 -> int1: an environment's climate is the usual kind of weather in that environment over a period of time; sent5 & sent8 -> int2: temperature and precipitation are properties of weather; int2 & sent11 -> int3: weather determines temperature and precipitation; int1 & int3 -> int4: an environment's climate determines the temperature and precipitation of a location; sent2 & sent9 -> int5: precipitation can affect the amount of water and sunlight in an environment; int4 & int5 -> int6: an environment's climate determines the temperature and amount of water and sunlight in a location; sent12 & sent6 -> int7: a plant requires sunlight to grow / survive; int7 & sent10 -> int8: plants require water and sunlight to grow / survive; sent1 & sent3 -> int9: if a plant requires something then that something is a resource for that plant; int8 & int9 -> int10: water and sunlight are resources for plants; int10 & sent4 -> int11: different plants require different amounts of water and sunlight to grow / survive; int11 & int6 -> hypothesis;

Hypothesis: smoking causes direct damage to the lungs
Context:
sent1: smoking is a kind of method for inhaling smoke 
sent2: harming something has a negative impact on / effect on that something 
sent3: a lung is a kind of internal organ 
sent4: if something harms something else, then that something also harms the parts of that something else 
sent5: to inhale means to breathe in 
sent6: smoke is a kind of gas 
sent7: internal organs are a part of the body 
sent8: damage has a negative impact on a thing 
sent9: when a lung breathes in air the air goes directly to the lungs 
sent10: smoking harms the body 
sent11: air contains gasses 
sent12: a lung is a kind of organ for breathing air 
Proof: sent3 & sent7 -> int1: lungs are a part of the body; int1 & sent4 -> int2: if something harms the body, then that something also harms the lungs; int2 & sent10 -> int3: smoking harms the lungs; int3 & sent1 -> int4: inhaling smoke by smoking harms the lungs; sent2 & sent8 -> int5: damage can mean harm; int4 & int5 -> int6: inhaling smoke by smoking causes damage to the lungs; sent12 & sent9 -> int7: a lung is a kind of organ for directly breathing in air; int7 & sent11 -> int8: a lung is a kind of organ for directly breathing in gasses; int8 & sent6 -> int9: lungs can be used for directly breathing in smoke; int9 & sent5 -> int10: lungs can be used for directly inhaling smoke; int10 & int6 -> hypothesis;
